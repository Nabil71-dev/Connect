# Thoughts & motive of dev for "IIUCconnect"


## This is the v.1.0 where many things have to fix-(like profile form update etc etc)

*I'm doing this project just to test my react knowledge

*In this project I have used so many things from react like (useEffect,useState,useReducer,useContext) most importantly custom hooks..maybe i have to use more in future vertion like (useMemo,useCallback)

*This project isn't reponsive so far, cause I haven't focus on other thing accept features , but it will be added in v.2.0

*There will be a Chatting feature maybe that will be added in v.3.0

------------------------About------------------------
